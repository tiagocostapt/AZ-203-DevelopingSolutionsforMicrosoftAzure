# Lab: Building a web application on Azure Platform-as-a-Service offerings
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You are the owner of a startup organization and have been building an image gallery application for people to share great images of food. To get your product to market as quickly as possible, you decided to use Microsoft Azure App Service to host your web applications and APIs. Recently, you realized that the images that are being uploaded to your application are simply too large. Out of concern for storage and bandwidth costs, you decided to use Azure Functions to process images in the background and shrink them down to thumbnails that can be loaded quickly.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create various apps by using the Azure App Service.

-   Configure application settings for an app.

-   Deploy apps by using Kudu, the Azure CLI, and zip deployment.

-   Author a function app to process Azure Storage images.

    > **Note**: You can minimize the tab by selecting the arrow immediately to the right of the tab header.

1. In the function editor, observe the example function script:

    ```cs
    public static void Run(Stream myBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} Bytes");
    }
    ```

1. **Delete** all the example code.

1. Within the editor, copy and paste the following placeholder function:

    ```cs
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
    }
    ```

1. In the editor, select **Save** to save the script and compile the code.

1. Add the following line of code to log information about the function execution:

    ```cs
    log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");
    ```

1. Add the following **using** statement to load the **Stream** for the input blob into the image library:

    ```cs
    using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
    {
    }
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code within the **using** statement to mutate the image by resizing the image and applying a grayscale filter:

    ```cs
    image.Mutate(i => 	
        i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
    );
    ```
1. Add the following line of code to save the new image to the **Stream** for the output blob:

    ```cs
    image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());
    ```

1. Your **Run** method should now resemble the following:

    ```cs
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");
        using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
        {
            image.Mutate(i => 	
                i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
            );
            image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());
        }
